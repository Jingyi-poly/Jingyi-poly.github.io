## About Me

I am a Research Scientist at the Department of Solver Development, Shenzhen Research Institute of Big Data. I received my Ph.D. in Industrial and Systems Engineering from the National University of Singapore in 2023, and completed my postdoctoral fellowship at Polytechnique Montréal in 2024.

My research focuses on developing advanced optimization algorithms and machine learning techniques for solving complex combinatorial optimization problems, particularly in the areas of vehicle routing, inventory management, and stochastic programming.

## Research Interests

- **Integrated learning to optimize** for solving dynamic and/or stochastic problems
- **Design effective methods** based on data structures and algorithms for NP-hard problems
- **GPU-based accelerated algorithms** for solving large-scale scenario stochastic problems
- **Combining OR technology** with other fields, such as energy and biological cancer screening
